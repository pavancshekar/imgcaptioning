# Image Captioning

## Overview
This project implements an image captioning system using deep learning. The model generates descriptive captions for images by leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequence generation.

## Features
- Uses a pre-trained CNN (e.g., ResNet, VGG16) to extract image features.
- Employs an RNN-based decoder (LSTM/GRU) for text generation.
- Utilizes an attention mechanism to improve caption quality.
- Supports training on custom datasets.
- Provides an inference pipeline to generate captions for new images.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- NLTK
- PIL (Pillow)

### Setup
Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/pavancshekar/imgcaptioning.git
cd imgcaptioning
```
Install dependencies:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset
This project uses the **MS-COCO** dataset for training. You can download it from [COCO Dataset](https://cocodataset.org/#download).

To use a custom dataset, ensure:
- Images are stored in a designated folder.
- Captions are in a CSV or JSON file linking images to their descriptions.

## Training the Model
Run the training script:
```sh
python train.py --epochs 10 --batch_size 32 --model lstm
```
You can adjust hyperparameters such as learning rate, number of epochs, and batch size in the configuration file or as command-line arguments.

## Testing & Inference
To generate captions for new images:
```sh
python inference.py --image sample.jpg
```
This will display the image along with the predicted caption.

## Model Architecture
- **Encoder:** A CNN extracts feature vectors from images.
- **Decoder:** An RNN (LSTM/GRU) generates captions.
- **Attention Mechanism:** Improves focus on relevant image regions during caption generation.

## Results
Sample generated captions:
- ![Sample Image](sample1.jpg) → *"A dog is running in a grassy field."
- ![Sample Image](sample2.jpg) → *"A group of people are sitting around a table."

## Future Enhancements
- Improve caption quality using transformer-based models.
- Add support for multilingual captioning.
- Implement a web interface for easy usage.
